title: ScotGov prototype kit
---

I've created a version of the GOV Proto Kit that includes the ScotGov Design System.

It's got the Design System package baked in and I've made a template / layout, and a header macro. Not a lot there but hopefully it's helpful to someone!

[You can find it over on GitHub](https://github.com/chrisadesign/scotgov-prototype-kit).

I'm probably not going to do much more to it unless there's a massive surge of support for it, there's enough there that you can quickly put together a prototype now though.
