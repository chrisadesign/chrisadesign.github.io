title: Video tutorial â€“ How to deploy a GOV.UK Prototype Kit to Heroku
---

I've made a second YouTube tutorial, this time covering [how to setup and deploy a prototype to Heroku](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtP97qSDlNg).

The video includes:
- how to setup an Heroku app using their dashboard GUI
- how to enable auto-deploys by linking your GitHub account
- how to add the username and password using the GUI
- a quick look at my [fork of the prototype kit](/Prototype-Kit-Fork/)
