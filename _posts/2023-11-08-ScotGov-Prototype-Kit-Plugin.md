title: GOV.UK Prototype Kit plugin for the Scottish Government Design System
---

A couple of years ago I created a fork of the prototype kit with the Scottish design system (ScotDS) embedded in it. I've not looked at it since and it's likely very out of date, but tings have also moved on with the prototype kit which now has plugins, so I've had a crack at creating a plugin to bring the ScotDS into the kit.
