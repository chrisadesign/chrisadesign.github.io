title: ScotGov Nova Snippets

As I did with the GOV.UK Design System, I've created some clips (aka snippets) for the Scottish Government Design System components. 

You can find a list of everything that's included and [install the extension](https://extensions.panic.com/extensions/ca/ca.ScotGovDesignSystemNovaSnippets/) over on the Nova site.

Enjoy!
