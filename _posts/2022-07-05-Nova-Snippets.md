title: Nova snippets extension for GOV.UK Design System
---

I recently moved to [Nova code editor](https://nova.app/) after the news that [Atom will soon be no more](https://github.blog/2022-06-08-sunsetting-atom/). One of the first things I do with a new editor (after installing the [Dracula theme](https://draculatheme.com/)) is setup some snippets as they save me so much time. Nova makes it really easy to package these up as an extension, so I've done just that.

The extension contains ‚Äúclips‚Äù (aka snippets) of the GOV.UK Design System, including styles, components, and patterns.

You can find a list of everything that's included and [install the extension](https://extensions.panic.com/extensions/ca/ca.GOVUKDesignSystemSnippets/) over on the Nova site.

If anyone is using Nova check it out üëç
