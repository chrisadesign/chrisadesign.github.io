title: Prototype kit starter, a fork of the official kit
---

When I start a new prototype for gov projects I tend to go do a lot of the same things, a lot of the same setup. To try and save myself some time I decided to fork the kit and have a version ready with some of the changes I like to make, and I figured I'd share it, because why not and open source and things.

Anyway, here it is, my [GOV.UK Prototype Kit fork](https://github.com/chrisadesign/govuk-prototype-kit).

As of right now it includes:
- a new ‘internal’ config variable which replace the GOV.UK logo with the service name and remove some other things
- a prototype phase banner
- a link in the footer to the currrent page in the heroku app
- a link in the footer to the git repo
- a feature and versioning system
- a date filter
