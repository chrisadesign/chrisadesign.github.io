## Interaction design contractor based in Scotland

I&rsquo;m currently working with [Cabinet Office](https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/cabinet-office) on a beta to improve the process for applying for a Gender Recognition Certificate, and [GDS](https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/government-digital-service) helping with continuous improvement for GovWifi.

In recent years I&rsquo;ve been helping other government departments deliver great services for their users.
